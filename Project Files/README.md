## Handwriting Recognition - Dead Sea Scrolls

This is the main project file for our project
In addition to these files, two trained models are also needed in the same folder:
1) https://drive.google.com/file/d/10NYOP5pGiOxucL2_Muek12nkHeaoL5GJ/view?usp=sharing
2) https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-iW-Ae8dYymQSYifb3BCqeOVLtF4-KBq/view?usp=sharing

- Once all files are in the same folder, the following command can be used to run the program:
```sh
py Segmentation.py path/to/test/images/
```
